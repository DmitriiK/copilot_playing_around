## Gameplay Summary
- The game consists of a square grid of buttons (the main grid) filled with emoji icons from a selected category (e.g., animals, food, or sports).
- At the top of the game field, there is a row called "Ordered items," which displays the sequence of icons to be clicked in order.
- The main grid is populated with icons when the page loads, while the "Ordered items" row starts empty and is populated when the game begins.
- Players must click the icons in the correct order as shown in the "Ordered items" row. Correct clicks update the row, and incorrect clicks briefly flash red.
- The game ends when all icons are clicked in the correct order.
